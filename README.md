# Movie box office prediction 
Movie box office prediction based on ensemble learning and big data analysis
## overview
Here is a Movie box office prediction including some preprocessing modules in Movie box office prediction (e.g., Statistic, Prediction and Causal Inference),and Ensemble learning algorithm, to build a predictive model, including Gradient Boosting Decision Tree and Random Forest model, and common classification algorithm decision trees. The results show that the Gradient Boosting Decision Tree gives the best performance, of which the regression evaluation criterion R^2 is higher than 0.995.
